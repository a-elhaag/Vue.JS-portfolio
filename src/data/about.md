I’m a **Software Engineer** who’s kinda obsessed with coding. I just **wanna** build cool stuff—whether it’s **web and mobile apps**, **AI backends**, or **cloud systems** that actually scale.

I’m also into the community side of things—I’m a **Gold Microsoft Student Ambassador** and the **founder of the Microsoft Student Club – ECU**. I’ve done **workshops**, **talks**, and even a whole **Machine Learning 101 series**. Teaching and sharing feels just as fun as coding itself.

But honestly, what keeps me going is the vibe of it all: those **late-night coding sessions**, trying out weird ideas, breaking stuff, fixing it, and then watching it actually work. For me, **software isn’t just a career—it’s my favorite hobby**. I don’t get bored of it; if anything, I just wanna dive deeper, explore more, and keep pushing myself.

At the end of the day, I’m all about taking messy, complicated problems and turning them into **human‑centric solutions** that actually make sense. That’s what makes me excited to keep doing this every day.
