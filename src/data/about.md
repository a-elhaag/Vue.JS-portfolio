I’m Anas — a software engineering student and certified AI engineer who builds systems that feel ==human-centric==. My stack: Vue 3 + TypeScript up front, FastAPI + Azure on the back. I prefer lean systems that don’t collapse under their own weight.

Over the past year I’ve led products under **Hexal Labs**—**Melo** (AI diet planner, second place) and **Inkr** (notes with memory). Serverless backbones, embeddings, and vector search that ship fast and scale honestly.

I care about **principles more than buzzwords**. Ship less, ship faster. Favor clarity over cleverness. Measure reality, don’t guess. Keep latency and accessibility on the same line as features.

Community matters. I founded **Code101** so students move from tutorials to shipping. As a Microsoft Student Ambassador, I break down Azure AI and LangChain so others can build—fewer slides, more demos.

Beyond engineering, I keep **rituals**: gym three times a week, horse riding for focus, car tinkering for patience. They’re feedback loops that make the hard parts easier.

My guiding line: when the work is honest, the outcome feels ==inevitable==. Build, measure, iterate—and then quietly do it again tomorrow.
